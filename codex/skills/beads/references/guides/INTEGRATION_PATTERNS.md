## session checklist Integration

**Both tools complement each other at different timescales:**

### Temporal Layering Pattern

**session checklist** (short-term working memory - this hour):
- Tactical execution: "Review Section 3", "Expand Q&A answers"
- Marked completed as you go
- Present/future tense ("Review", "Expand", "Create")
- Ephemeral: Disappears when session ends

**Beads** (long-term episodic memory - this week/month):
- Strategic objectives: "Continue work on strategic planning document"
- Key decisions and outcomes in notes field
- Past tense in notes ("COMPLETED", "Discovered", "Blocked by")
- Persistent: Survives compaction and session boundaries

**Key insight**: session checklist = working copy for the current hour. Beads = project journal for the current month.

### The Handoff Pattern

1. **Session start**: Read bead → Create session checklist items for immediate actions
2. **During work**: Mark session checklist items completed as you go
3. **Reach milestone**: Update bead notes with outcomes + context
4. **Session end**: session checklist disappears, bead survives with enriched notes

**After compaction**: session checklist is gone forever, but bead notes reconstruct what happened.

### Example: session checklist tracks execution, Beads capture meaning

**session checklist (ephemeral execution view):**
```
[completed] Implement login endpoint
[in_progress] Add password hashing with bcrypt
[pending] Create session middleware
```

**Corresponding bead notes (persistent context):**
```bash
bd update issue-123 --notes "COMPLETED: Login endpoint with bcrypt password
hashing (12 rounds). KEY DECISION: Using JWT tokens (not sessions) for stateless
auth - simplifies horizontal scaling. IN PROGRESS: Session middleware implementation.
NEXT: Need user input on token expiry time (1hr vs 24hr trade-off)."
```

**What's different**:
- session checklist: Task names (what to do)
- Beads: Outcomes and decisions (what was learned, why it matters)

**Don't duplicate**: session checklist tracks execution, Beads captures meaning and context.

### When to Update Each Tool

**Update session checklist** (frequently):
- Mark task completed as you finish each one
- Add new tasks as you break down work
- Update in_progress when switching tasks

**Update Beads** (at milestones):
- Completed a significant piece of work
- Made a key decision that needs documentation
- Hit a blocker that pauses progress
- About to ask user for input
- Session token usage > 70%
- End of session

**Pattern**: session checklist changes every few minutes. Beads updates every hour or at natural breakpoints.

### Full Workflow Example

**Scenario**: Implement OAuth authentication (multi-session work)

**Session 1 - Planning**:
```bash
# Create bd issue
bd create "Implement OAuth authentication" -t feature -p 0 --design "
JWT tokens with refresh rotation.
See BOUNDARIES.md for bd vs session checklist decision.
"

# Mark in_progress
bd update oauth-1 --status in_progress

# Create session checklist for today's work
session checklist:
- [ ] Research OAuth 2.0 refresh token flow
- [ ] Design token schema
- [ ] Set up test environment
```

**End of Session 1**:
```bash
# Update bd with outcomes
bd update oauth-1 --notes "COMPLETED: Researched OAuth2 refresh flow. Decided on 7-day refresh tokens.
KEY DECISION: RS256 over HS256 (enables key rotation per security review).
IN PROGRESS: Need to set up test OAuth provider.
NEXT: Configure test provider, then implement token endpoint."

# session checklist disappears when session ends
```

**Session 2 - Implementation** (after compaction):
```bash
# Read bd to reconstruct context
bd show oauth-1
# See: COMPLETED research, NEXT is configure test provider

# Create fresh session checklist from NEXT
session checklist:
- [ ] Configure test OAuth provider
- [ ] Implement token endpoint
- [ ] Add basic tests

# Work proceeds...

# Update bd at milestone
bd update oauth-1 --notes "COMPLETED: Test provider configured, token endpoint implemented.
TESTS: 5 passing (token generation, validation, expiry).
IN PROGRESS: Adding refresh token rotation.
NEXT: Implement rotation, add rate limiting, security review."
```

## writing-plans Integration

**For complex multi-step features**, the design field in bd issues can link to detailed implementation plans that break work into bite-sized RED-GREEN-REFACTOR steps.

### When to Create Detailed Plans

**Use detailed plans for:**
- Complex features with multiple components
- Multi-session work requiring systematic breakdown
- Features where TDD discipline adds value (core logic, critical paths)
- Work that benefits from explicit task sequencing

**Skip detailed plans for:**
- Simple features (single function, straightforward logic)
- Exploratory work (API testing, pattern discovery)
- Infrastructure setup (configuration, wiring)

**The test:** If you can implement it in one session without a checklist, skip the detailed plan.

### Using the writing-plans Skill

When design field needs detailed breakdown, reference the **writing-plans** skill:

**Pattern:**
```bash
# Create issue with high-level design
bd create "Implement OAuth token refresh" --design "
Add JWT refresh token flow with rotation.
See docs/plans/2025-10-23-oauth-refresh-design.md for detailed plan.
"

# Then use writing-plans skill to create detailed plan
# The skill creates: docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md
```

**Detailed plan structure** (from writing-plans):
- Bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each)
- Explicit RED-GREEN-REFACTOR steps per task
- Exact file paths and complete code
- Verification commands with expected output
- Frequent commit points

**Example task from detailed plan:**
```markdown
### Task 1: Token Refresh Endpoint

**Files:**
- Create: `src/auth/refresh.py`
- Test: `tests/auth/test_refresh.py`

**Step 1: Write failing test**
```python
def test_refresh_token_returns_new_access_token():
    refresh_token = create_valid_refresh_token()
    response = refresh_endpoint(refresh_token)
    assert response.status == 200
    assert response.access_token is not None
```

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**
Run: `pytest tests/auth/test_refresh.py::test_refresh_token_returns_new_access_token -v`
Expected: FAIL with "refresh_endpoint not defined"

**Step 3: Implement minimal code**
[... exact implementation ...]

**Step 4: Verify test passes**
[... verification ...]

**Step 5: Commit**
```bash
git add tests/auth/test_refresh.py src/auth/refresh.py
git commit -m "feat: add token refresh endpoint"
```
```

### Integration with bd Workflow

**Three-layer structure**:
1. **bd issue**: Strategic objective + high-level design
2. **Detailed plan** (writing-plans): Step-by-step execution guide
3. **session checklist**: Current task within the plan

**During planning phase:**
1. Create bd issue with high-level design
2. If complex: Use writing-plans skill to create detailed plan
3. Link plan in design field: `See docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`

**During execution phase:**
1. Open detailed plan (if exists)
2. Use session checklist to track current task within plan
3. Update bd notes at milestones, not per-task
4. Close bd issue when all plan tasks complete

**Don't duplicate:** Detailed plan = execution steps. BD notes = outcomes and decisions.

**Example bd notes after using detailed plan:**
```bash
bd update oauth-5 --notes "COMPLETED: Token refresh endpoint (5 tasks from plan: endpoint + rotation + tests)
KEY DECISION: 7-day refresh tokens (vs 30-day) - reduces risk of token theft
TESTS: All 12 tests passing (auth, rotation, expiry, error handling)"
```

### When NOT to Use Detailed Plans

**Red flags:**
- Feature is simple enough to implement in one pass
- Work is exploratory (discovering patterns, testing APIs)
- Infrastructure work (OAuth setup, MCP configuration)
- Would spend more time planning than implementing

**Rule of thumb:** Use detailed plans when systematic breakdown prevents mistakes, not for ceremony.

**Pattern summary**:
- **Simple feature**: bd issue only
- **Complex feature**: bd issue + session checklist
- **Very complex feature**: bd issue + writing-plans + session checklist

## Cross-Skill Workflows

### Pattern: Research Document with Strategic Planning

**Scenario**: User asks "Help me write a strategic planning document for Q4"

**Tools used**: beads + developing-strategic-documents skill

**Workflow**:
1. Create bd issue for tracking:
   ```bash
   bd create "Q4 strategic planning document" -t task -p 0
   bd update strat-1 --status in_progress
   ```

2. Use developing-strategic-documents skill for research and writing

3. Update bd notes at milestones:
   ```bash
   bd update strat-1 --notes "COMPLETED: Research phase (reviewed 5 competitor docs, 3 internal reports)
   KEY DECISION: Focus on market expansion over cost optimization per exec input
   IN PROGRESS: Drafting recommendations section
   NEXT: Get exec review of draft recommendations before finalizing"
   ```

4. session checklist tracks immediate writing tasks:
   ```
   - [ ] Draft recommendation 1: Market expansion
   - [ ] Add supporting data from research
   - [ ] Create budget estimates
   ```

**Why this works**: bd preserves context across sessions (document might take days), skill provides writing framework, session checklist tracks current work.

### Pattern: Multi-File Refactoring

**Scenario**: Refactor authentication system across 8 files

**Tools used**: beads + systematic-debugging (if issues found)

**Workflow**:
1. Create epic and subtasks:
   ```bash
   bd create "Refactor auth system to use JWT" -t epic -p 0
   bd create "Update login endpoint" -t task
   bd create "Update token validation" -t task
   bd create "Update middleware" -t task
   bd create "Update tests" -t task

   # Link hierarchy (child depends on parent)
   bd dep add login-1 auth-epic --type parent-child
   bd dep add validation-2 auth-epic --type parent-child
   bd dep add middleware-3 auth-epic --type parent-child
   bd dep add tests-4 auth-epic --type parent-child
   # Or use --parent at creation time:
   # bd create "Update login endpoint" -t task --parent auth-epic

   # Add ordering
   bd dep add validation-2 login-1  # validation depends on login
   bd dep add middleware-3 validation-2  # middleware depends on validation
   bd dep add tests-4 middleware-3  # tests depend on middleware
   ```

2. Work through subtasks in order, using session checklist for each:
   ```
   Current: login-1
   session checklist:
   - [ ] Update login route signature
   - [ ] Add JWT generation
   - [ ] Update tests
   - [ ] Verify backward compatibility
   ```

3. Update bd notes as each completes:
   ```bash
   bd close login-1 --reason "Updated to JWT. Tests passing. Backward compatible with session auth."
   ```

4. If issues discovered, use systematic-debugging skill + create blocker issues

**Why this works**: bd tracks dependencies and progress across files, session checklist focuses on current file, skills provide specialized frameworks when needed.

## Decision Framework

### Which Tool for Which Purpose?

| Need | Tool | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Track today's execution | session checklist | Lightweight, shows current progress |
| Preserve context across sessions | bd | Survives compaction, persistent memory |
| Detailed implementation steps | writing-plans | RED-GREEN-REFACTOR breakdown |
| Research document structure | developing-strategic-documents | Domain-specific framework |
| Debug complex issue | systematic-debugging | Structured debugging protocol |

### Decision Tree

```
Is this work done in this session?
├─ Yes → Use session checklist only
└─ No → Use bd
    ├─ Simple feature → bd issue + session checklist
    └─ Complex feature → bd issue + writing-plans + session checklist

Will conversation history get compacted?
├─ Likely → Use bd (context survives)
└─ Unlikely → session checklist is sufficient

Does work have dependencies or blockers?
├─ Yes → Use bd (tracks relationships)
└─ No → session checklist is sufficient

Is this specialized domain work?
├─ Research/writing → developing-strategic-documents
├─ Complex debugging → systematic-debugging
├─ Detailed implementation → writing-plans
└─ General tracking → bd + session checklist
```

### Integration Anti-Patterns

**Don't**:
- Duplicate session checklist tasks into bd notes (different purposes)
- Create bd issues for single-session linear work (use session checklist)
- Put detailed implementation steps in bd notes (use writing-plans)
- Update bd after every session checklist task (update at milestones)
- Use writing-plans for exploratory work (defeats the purpose)

**Do**:
- Update bd when changing tools or reaching milestones
- Use session checklist as "working copy" of bd's NEXT section
- Link between tools (bd design field → writing-plans file path)
- Choose the right level of formality for the work complexity

---

## Summary

**Key principle**: Each tool operates at a different timescale and level of detail.

- **session checklist**: Minutes to hours (current execution)
- **bd**: Hours to weeks (persistent context)
- **writing-plans**: Days to weeks (detailed breakdown)
- **Other skills**: As needed (domain frameworks)

**Integration pattern**: Use the lightest tool sufficient for the task, add heavier tools only when complexity demands it.
